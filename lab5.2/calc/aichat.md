Rranscript: Input Questions & Answers

You (initial code):

public String visitInputExpr(ParseRules.InputExpr ctx) {
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    String name = input.nextLine();
    return name;
}


Error you got (Maven):

cannot find symbol
symbol:   class InputExpr
location: class si413.ParseRules


My response:

The error happened because your grammar (ParseRules.g4) didn’t have a rule named InputExpr.

Once you added | INPUT #InputExpr in your expr rule, ANTLR generated ParseRules.InputExprContext.

You needed to change your visitor signature to:

@Override
public String visitInputExpr(ParseRules.InputExprContext ctx) {
    return stdin.nextLine();
}


You (later):

public String visitInputExpr(ParseRules.InputExpr ctx) {
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    String name = input.nextLine();
    return name;
}


My correction:

Don’t create a new Scanner each time, reuse your field:

private Scanner stdin = new Scanner(System.in);



Then:

@Override
public String visitInputExpr(ParseRules.InputExprContext ctx) {
    return stdin.nextLine();
}


Summary I gave you about grammar:

The InputExprContext is generated because your grammar has:

expr
  : INPUT #InputExpr
  ;


ctx.INPUT().getText() would just give you "i".

visit(ctx.expr()) doesn’t apply here, because there’s no nested expression.

The correct action is to pause for input using stdin.nextLine() and return that string.

Final Recommendation:
Keep a single Scanner stdin = new Scanner(System.in); as a field, and implement:

What does this mean1) You're not handling all the errors correctly. Remember, anytime your interpreter would normally crash, you should be exiting with an error code of 7. 

2) It looks like you're having an issue where your parser is interpreting something in the last few lines of the example program as requiring input from the user, but since all the input has been used up, it crashes out. Take a look at the logic and make sure you're only doing what you should be doing for the interpreter.



This feedback is highly specific and likely comes from a scenario where you are developing a programming language interpreter or a parser for a class, a personal project, or a professional tool. It points out two distinct and critical issues in how your program handles errors and input.

Here's a breakdown of what each point means and what you likely need to fix:

1. Error Handling and Exit Code
This point is about robustness and following a standard for command-line tools.

What it Means
"You're not handling all the errors correctly." This is a general critique, meaning some runtime problems—like a division by zero, accessing an out-of-bounds array index, or trying to use an undefined variable—are currently causing your interpreter program to crash (abnormally terminate) instead of gracefully catching the problem and exiting.

"Anytime your interpreter would normally crash, you should be exiting with an error code of 7." The exit code (or status code) is a small integer value that a program returns to the operating system when it finishes.

An exit code of 0 typically means the program succeeded.

Non-zero codes are used to signal errors.

The specific number 7 is an arbitrary, but required, standard for your project (or a convention in some programming contexts like sysexits.h which uses 7 for "internal software error").

What to Fix
You need to implement or improve your error handling throughout the interpreter's execution phase.

Identify Potential Crashes: Figure out all the places where your interpreter could encounter an illegal operation and currently just stops.

Implement an Error Mechanism: When a fatal error is detected (like an unrecoverable syntax error or a runtime exception), your program should:

Print a clear error message to the standard error stream (stderr).

Stop execution immediately.

Call an exit function (like exit(7) in C/C++ or similar in other languages) to return 7 to the operating system.

2. Input Consumption and Parsing Logic
This point is about the interaction between your parser, the program input, and the end-of-file (EOF) condition.

What it Means
"Your parser is interpreting something in the last few lines of the example program as requiring input from the user..." Your program is likely encountering an instruction (like read, get_input, or similar) that expects data from the program's input stream (like standard input, stdin).

"...but since all the input has been used up, it crashes out." When the parser hits this input-requiring instruction, it tries to read from the stream, but it immediately hits the End-of-File (EOF) marker because all the provided input has already been read. Instead of handling this EOF gracefully, your program is crashing or failing a requirement of the assignment.

The underlying issue: It suggests your parser or interpreter is mistakenly trying to over-read past the end of the provided program input, possibly due to a logical error in determining when a statement is complete or when to stop processing the program file itself.

What to Fix
Focus on how your interpreter's lexical analysis or parsing phase handles the end of the source code file.

Check Input-Reading Logic: Review the code that handles your language's input command. It must check for the EOF condition before attempting to read. If EOF is reached unexpectedly when an input value is required, you should probably handle it as an error (and likely exit with code 7, as per point 1).

Verify Program Termination: Make sure your main parsing loop stops cleanly when it reaches the true end of the source file. It shouldn't try to process "phantom" lines or instructions after the program code is finished.

why is my parsing of [ ] getting rid of when it is not supposed to public String visitLitExpr(ParseRules.LitExprContext ctx) {

String word = ctx.LIT().getText();



word = word.replaceAll("(?<!\\$)\\[","");

word = word.replaceAll("(?<!\\$)\\]","");

if(word.contains("$[") && word.contains("$]")) {

word = word.replace("$[", "");

word = word.replace("$]", "");

}

return word;



Based on the Java code snippet you provided, the reason your parsing of [ ] is getting rid of the brackets even when you think it shouldn't is due to the regular expressions you are using:

Java

word = word.replaceAll("(?<!\\$)\\[","");
word = word.replaceAll("(?<!\\$)\\]","");
Regular Expression Breakdown
The regex (?<!\\$)\\[ and (?<!\\$)\\] are designed to match and replace a square bracket ([ or ]) unless it is immediately preceded by a dollar sign ($). This is known as a negative lookbehind.

\\[ and \\] are the literal square bracket characters (escaped because they are special characters in regex).

(?<!\\$) is the negative lookbehind that asserts the preceding character is not a literal dollar sign (\$).

This means the code does the following:

Removes all standalone brackets: For a simple bracket like [word] or word[with]brackets, both the opening and closing brackets will be removed because they are not preceded by a $.

Keeps escaped brackets: For a sequence like $[word$], the opening [ is preceded by $ and the closing ] is preceded by $, so the regex will not match them, and they will be preserved at this stage.

The if Condition and Redundancy
The next block of code then removes the escaped brackets:

Java

if(word.contains("$[") && word.contains("$]")) {
    word = word.replace("$[", "");
    word = word.replace("$]", "");
}
This block is designed to remove the "escaped" sequences ($[, $]) that the regex purposefully ignored.

Conclusion on Removal
If your intent was to only remove the brackets that are not preceded by a $, your regex is correct for that purpose. However, if your intent was to preserve all brackets unless they were part of some other special syntax, your current logic is flawed because it removes all un-escaped brackets.

Example:

Input String	word.replaceAll("(?<!\\$)\\[","") result	word.replaceAll("(?<!\\$)\\]","") result	Final Output (After if block)
hello[world]	helloworld]	helloworld	helloworld
$[$word$]	$[$word$]	$[$word$]	word
mixed$[test]case	mixed$[	mixed$	mixed$

How to Fix It (Based on Likely Intent)
If your goal is to only remove the brackets if they are part of the unwanted simple syntax, but keep them for some other purpose, you need to adjust your logic based on what you want to keep.

If you intended to preserve all brackets that are not part of the $[]$ syntax, then your regex is removing too much. You should adjust what you are targeting for removal.

If the input is from a lexer/parser (suggested by visitLitExpr and ParseRules.LitExprContext), it's common for the literal text (ctx.LIT().getText()) to include surrounding quotes or delimiters which you might be trying to clean up. If that's the case, your removal of all un-escaped brackets is likely removing delimiters you need.
