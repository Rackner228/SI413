shhh This is a simple program in the DRAMA QUEEN language shhh
shhh HEAR_YE() serves as a call to print the enclosed expression shhh
shhh The spaces just inside the ~'s are required, and do not go into the string itself shhh
HEAR_YE(~ I am a DRAMATIC LANGUAGE ~) shhh I NEED MY SPACE! shhh

HEAR_YE(REVERTERE(GIVE_ME))
shhh GIVE_ME takes a single line of text from the console as a string. REVERTERE reverses a string given to it shhh

shhh In order to concatenate strings you use the UNIFY operator as shown below shhh
HEAR_YE(~ I will be as DRAMATIC ~ UNIFY ~   ~ UNIFY ~ as I WANT ~)

shhh Should you like to print a ~, all you have to do is join any combination of capital letters to the opening tilde as well as the ending tilde. Now any tilde on the inside can be printed shhh
HEAR_YE(~APPLE I'd like to print a ~ thank you very much. ~APPLE)
